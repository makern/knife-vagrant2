knife-vagrant3
==============

This plugin is an extended version of the [knife-vagrant2 plugin](https://github.com/makern/knife-vagrant2), that adds the ability to create and attach storage when launching the boxes.

This plugin exists temporarily until changes that do not belong in the knife-vagrant2 are moved to the knife-stackbuilder plugin. So please do not use this plugin unless you are using it via knife-stackbuilder. A future version of knife-stackbuilder will revert back to knife-vagrant2, at which point this fork will go away.
